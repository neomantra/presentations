/init 

---

## 2026-01-13T23:38:56Z

operate agent.md to create the presentation.  if you need a plan.md go ahead

---

## 2026-01-14T00:06:22Z

to the timeline, which can be bigger i want to have icons for major themes, not every slide needs a new one
start with the eye emoji 👀 for multimodal.   
insert a new slide at 3 that has claude codes release date of february 24 2025 and include a claude icon init. subnote the beginning TUI re-acceptance (not Charm pivot to Crush) revolution.  
for MCP you can use a robot.   for gemini and opus and vibing you can put some waves or maybe the head with spiral eyes 😵‍💫
after you do that, i will review the rest.

---

## 2026-01-14T00:09:05Z

put the icons below the timebar and don't reveal the unacheived milestones

---

## 2026-01-14T00:12:07Z

looking great.  we will tighten up the content.   since there was a bunch of javascript, let's start by you printing out the slide list

---

## 2026-01-14T00:13:36Z

since i will distribute this deck and have it live, I want links for relevant things.  i like your current format generally, but you can slide the content up and have a space underneath for relevant code or links.  for now do not put any code, but if there are relevant links, put them in the bottom

---

## 2026-01-14T00:18:37Z

for those links you added, put the full URLs in the bottom so people with photos can find it.  but you can add links to what you already highlight in the slides.

---

## 2026-01-14T00:24:19Z

add a slide for google releasing the successful image model nano banana on august 26 2025.  give it a banana emoji

---

## 2026-01-14T00:27:56Z

also add a slide for deepseek r1 20 january 2025, using reinforcement learning and an open weights and research papers.  also add a slide for anthropic releasing model context protocol on november 25 2024

---

## 2026-01-14T00:30:50Z

honestly how long would it take to present this, don't make any changes, just give me a per slide estimate and a total

---

## 2026-01-14T01:31:50Z

go ahead and condense all the corporate announcements, including nano banana, into a quick set of sections that advance on the same slide and expose their milestones as they go.  then we jump to my work with MCP servers.

---

## 2026-01-14T01:52:00Z

on the title page, you can put my name Evan Wies and my email evan@neomantra.net.

on the TUI page, put the images using  href https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/blob/main/cmd/ot-simplegen/demo.gif
https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/blob/main/cmd/ot-timechart/demo.gif 

for MCP server page, put it on its own sub-line and instead of "DataBento" put "`dbn-go-mcp` for DataBento market data, and a sub-line `buttplug-mcp` for device access, add its Github link.  then dank-mcp gets its own line and the rest.
embed https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-go/raw/main/cmd/dbn-go-mcp/claude_get_cost.png for dbn-go-mcp
embed https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb8e56f-178d-4646-9e0f-4fcf57614dea for dank-mcp with it queued at second 00:22.

that's enough for now

---

## 2026-01-14T02:18:15Z

on the mcp  add this image of agentdank in images.
on the antigravity page add the dank-webchat and dank-data-explorer images

---

## 2026-01-14T02:19:29Z

on the ollamatea page, add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/main/tests/ollamatea-512.png as the first image

---

## 2026-01-14T02:20:38Z

put the ollamatea image to the right of the buleltpoints instead

---

## 2026-01-14T02:23:46Z

next to agent dank you can put buttplug.io https://buttplug.io/assets/images/logo-38018d3af54f9cadbcfa380c51e63cb7.png

---

## 2026-01-14T02:30:54Z

add the proving parallelograms and quadratic equations image

---

## 2026-01-14T02:33:05Z

on the vibe coding for kids page, i want you to use the images in the images directory, proving-paralleograms.png and quadratic-explorer.png

---

## 2026-01-14T02:41:35Z

on the vibe baot engineering, add a boat emjoji to the slide title, but not the timeline.  add the images in the images directory: WeaselToonBowUpgrade.png  vibe-engineering-1.png vibe-engineering-2.png

---

## 2026-01-14T02:55:30Z

make an analysis of how long this presentation will take.  don't make assumptions about my time limits

---

## 2026-01-14T03:00:22Z

Keep everything for it but hide the artistic license slide, i will unhide it later in my process

---

## 2026-01-14T03:54:48Z

we are continuing working on this presentation but we lost context.  review the directory

---

## 2026-01-14T03:56:55Z

i got it working on github pages at https://neomantra.github.io/presentations/GolangMeetupJan2026/presentation.html
i think we should rename presentation.html to index.html so it's picked up better.
also it doesn't work well on mobile, can you see if you can improve that at all?

---

## 2026-01-14T04:17:50Z

On multimodal debugging, put pictures of proving-parallelograms-bug.png and proving-parallelograms-bugfix.png .  in between put my prompt `a friend discovered a bug in this.  look at the attached picture, figure out what the bug is and correct it.`

---

## 2026-01-14T04:20:20Z

i have added the  missing file  try again

---

## 2026-01-14T04:22:27Z

on the antigravity+frontier models page, vibe coding for kids page, multimodal debugging page , and vibe boat engineering page, you can increase the image sizes by 15%

---

## 2026-01-14T04:24:36Z

now each of the images on those pages and the mcp exploration page, i want clicking the image to open their respective image in a new window, i will use it to zoom in during the presentation.  do for all except for agentdank himself and the buttplug, they don't need to be linked

---

## 2026-01-14T04:29:24Z

it's a bit of a pain on mobile because of the interface.  is there a full-screen mode that's possible?

---

## 2026-01-14T04:33:58Z

on the final llm-renessaince page, 
for NTChart multimodal + terminal testing, hyperlink that to https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ntcharts/issues/7
for AgentDank improvements, put AgentDank `dank-extract` and hyperlink to https://github.com/AgentDank/dank-extract
for OSS devops: Travis -> GitHub Actions hyperlink to https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/issues/289
for this presentation, link to https://github.com/neomantra/presentations/tree/master/GolangMeetupJan2026 

---

## 2026-01-14T04:42:03Z

rename the title slide from "My LLM Journey" to "We've Turned The Corner" and the subtitle from "From Experiments to Practial Work" to "From LLM Experients to Practical Execution"

---

## 2026-01-14T04:43:25Z

meh Practial Execution is lame ... I want to say i get practical work done in utilizing these new technologies

---

## 2026-01-14T04:45:02Z

From LLM Experiments to Getting Work Done

---

## 2026-01-14T04:51:10Z

since it wraps around , put a slide with a FIN sign to demarcate the end of the presentation. you can make the FIN sign fancy like the old time movies.

---

## 2026-01-14T04:54:29Z

it is not going fullscreen on my iphone... anything we can do about that?

---

## 2026-01-14T11:26:33Z

on the multimodal debugging slide, add an inital text that say "Full debugging cycle from a screenshot"
then the next line that says "Simple input, harnessing:"
 * Multi-modal understanding
 * Tool calling
 * Agentic looping

---

## 2026-01-14T11:28:12Z

you can take multiple indented lines for the bullet points afters harnessing

---

## 2026-01-14T11:33:45Z

change "multi-modal understanding" to "multi-modal capability" and add a line for "world understanding" under it

---

## 2026-01-14T11:37:17Z

on that page, center the "See image ->" line

---

## 2026-01-14T12:55:50Z

Add a Jun 2025 slide Take a Shot at Vibe Coding.   Vibe coding was getting popular, I already used Copilot auto-complete heavily and was constantly asking the LLMs coding questions.  I tried to make an AgentDank website, starting with an age verification screen, without concentrating on the code at all.  When I did look at the code, I wasn't too happy with it.  After a few hours I still had nothing useful and felt behind what my natural tempo and I stopped, considering it not ready.

---

## 2026-01-14T13:22:39Z

on that slide, put a thumbs down emoji to signify my failure.  add it to the timeline, but don't include it with the industry achievements reveal

---

## 2026-01-14T13:24:12Z

on the industry milestones page can you hide the thumbs down in the timeline?

---

## 2026-01-14T13:25:31Z

on the LLM-assisted renaissance page, add a rocketship emoji and also include it in the timeline

---

## 2026-01-14T13:56:09Z

create a readme.md for humans, which describes the REPOSITORY and VIBE CODING A PRESENTATION aspect.  You can also include a summary and the slides table of contents, but the page is just an introduction to the presentation, the contents of the presentation speak for themselves

---

## 2026-01-14T13:59:27Z

near the top, add a link to the PROMPTS.md and note to the reader that they can read the evolution there, or see the checkpoints at the commits page https://github.com/neomantra/presentations/commits/master/

---

## 2026-01-14T14:05:04Z

create a QR code with the following link https://neomantra.github.io/presentations/GolangMeetupJan2026/    in the center should be the logo in images/neomantra-logo-blue.png and it should have a black border with a rounded rectangle enclosing it.  Underneath is a filled rounded rectangle with the word "Deck" underneatch in sans serif font and contrasting color consistent with the presentation.  place that qr code image in the images directory and add it to the main slide.

---

## 2026-01-14T14:11:24Z

that's great, can you make the deck bubble below the QR code as wide as the qr code, the word Deck can be a bit bigger

---

## 2026-01-14T14:12:26Z

deck should be double the size and bold and all caps

---

## 2026-01-14T14:21:36Z

that's great.  also make a qrcode with the same logo but go to this URL https://github.com/neomantra/presentations/tree/master/GolangMeetupJan2026 and with the word "REPO" underneath

---

## 2026-01-14T14:23:14Z

i've tested that and it looks great.  you can add it to the title slide, to the right of the other QR code.  leave some horizontal seperation from them to make it easier for cameras to disambiguate.   also add them to the final fin slide

---

## 2026-01-14T14:26:31Z

on the title page, you can make them larger and centered beneath the contact information.  

---

## 2026-01-14T14:27:04Z

make them 25% larger and add a little more horizontal separation

---

## 2026-01-14T14:27:34Z

again, make them 25% larger and add a little more horizontal separation

---

## 2026-01-14T14:28:14Z

that's great, now make them 260px and then apply all the same styling to the qr codes on the fin page

---

## 2026-01-14T14:32:27Z

I had SuperGrok review the presentation and we came up with a better title and subtitle.  The title is now "LLM Odyssey 2025" and the subtitle is "From TUI Experiments to Agentic Wins in Golang".   Go through and update the relevant documents to reflect this change including the README.md and CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files. be sure to update the <title> too. 

---

## 2026-01-14T14:35:39Z

on my iphone 17, sometimes a bunch of the content appears under the floating URL bar and other UX.  It makes it impossible to read.  is there a better way to handle that?

---

## 2026-01-14T14:40:07Z

Also on the title page, keep the timeline but hide the eyeballs, they are intended for the TUI+Multimodal Models slide.  
On the TUI+Multimodal Models slide, change the title to "Local LLM TUI + Multimodal Models" Change the Combined with `dbn-go` DetaBento library" to say "Combined with `dbn-go` [DataBento market data](https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-go/)"  .  also include that link in the set of explicit links at the bottom

---

## 2026-01-14T14:43:38Z

on the Local LLM TUI slide, in its title change "Multimodal Models" to "Multi-modal Models".  In this slides timeline, the plug emoji is revealed, that is for the next slide page.  change the `dbn-go` styling to be the same as the OllamaTea and NTCharts links and you can unlink "DataBento"

---

## 2026-01-14T14:48:04Z

on the industry milestones page, don't show the plug emoji until the first industry milestone reveal.  you can also add these links https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek for DeepSeek and for nanobanana add this link https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/nano-banana-pro/     change it so that the links at the bottom are revealed as the page advances

---

## 2026-01-14T14:55:56Z

on the MCP Exploration page, change dbn-go-mcp and buttplug-mcp to have the same styling as dank-mcp.  Change  "Built MCP servers" to "Built MCP servers with mcp-go" and link mcp-go to https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go .  For "Cannabis dataset queries via DuckDB + Claude" put "Connect Claude with cannabis datasets via DuckDB SQL".

---

## 2026-01-14T15:00:29Z

on Vibe Boat Engineering, add a timeline item with the same boat emoji.  Change "Multimodal CAD assistance" to "Multi-modal mechanical design assistance" and link "pontoon boat" to https://tinypontoonboats.com and add a link at the bottom and change "improvment" to "upgrade"

---

## 2026-01-14T15:02:12Z

in the timeline the boat overlaps with the rocketship, can you slide it to the left a little bit even if it doesn't mathematically match the temporal proportion

---

## 2026-01-14T15:05:41Z

On "Take this stuff and solve your problems with it!" rename it to "Wield this magic1\nUse it to solve your problems..."  also since it is a concluding slide you can vertically center it all more.

---

## 2026-01-14T15:09:21Z

The mobile version got a little worse when you changed it before.  The top of the slides are always covered by the iphone status bar (this is ios 26).  also the QR codes lose their aspect ratio in this mode and become unreadable.  I will use the responsive mode of safari to help test this in our iterations, i wasn't doing that before

---

## 2026-01-14T15:13:19Z

you can make the qr code bigger, maybe max 60%.  the primary issue for them was the aspect ratio

---

## 2026-01-14T15:15:29Z

can you review this again for time?  i have a 15 minute slot

---

## 2026-01-14T15:21:09Z

We are now working on the Swift -> 3D Model page.   Change the title to "Photo -> Swift Code -> 3D Model".   Change WeaselToonCadova to the same link font we use for projects elsewhere.  Include its link at the bottom.  Change "Started with Claude Desktop, got serious with Claude Code" to "Started with Claude Desktop, then evolved  to human-less agentic looping with Claude Code".   While you do that, I'll get some images ready to put underneath.

---

## 2026-01-14T15:22:45Z

change "Photo → Swift Code → 3D Model" to "Image -> Swift Code -> 3D Model -> Image..." to evoke the idea of a loop

---

## 2026-01-14T15:25:14Z

In general, we have one style for links to projects that i like, on that page Cadova and WeaselToonCadova are examples.  But also we have "ground truth" styled, and i like that, but i think it should be different than links.  Create a distinct CSS style for that which is similar, but italicized and a different appropriate color.  go through the presentation and apply that styling to unlinked but key phrases (eg already styled)

---

## 2026-01-14T15:34:12Z

we are adding these pictures to the bottom, with the same treatment as other pages.  from left to right, all in images folder, pontoon_prompt_1.png pontoon_code.png pontoon_swift_first.jpg pontoon_swift_final.png

---

## 2026-01-14T15:37:31Z

let's merge the top two lines, "Discovered Cadova, a Swift library for parametric, 3D CSG modeling"
On "Like how Claude generates DOCX or SVG..." "Like how Claude generates DOCX or SVG... this is Swift code -> 3MF model"

---

## 2026-01-14T15:39:01Z

the right most image is pontoon_swift_final.jpg not .png

---

## 2026-01-14T15:41:48Z

On LLM-assisted Renaissance, add a main bullet point "Now I am jacked in with multiple LLMs with multiple workflows with multiple projects simultaneously" " then another line "Unencumbered personal advancement, although not a panacea"  then leave some vertical whitespace for the different projects

---

## 2026-01-14T15:42:51Z

on "multimodal debugging", let's move the quote "A friend discovered a bug in this. Look at the attached picture, figure out what the bug is and correct it."  to the right side of the bullet-point text content

---

## 2026-01-14T15:45:18Z

On LLM-assisted renaissance, break the first line into two bullet points: "Now I am jacked in with multiple projects simultaneously" "With multiple LLMs, multiple workflows, multiple tools".  Then put the Unencumbered bullet point in the floating text boxes that other slides have.  that will be a good visual separation of the projects.

---

## 2026-01-14T15:47:35Z

on that slide, fixup "dank-extract" to be a styled link.  change "HyperCube Vision + mesh shaders" to "HyperCube Viewer on Vision Pro via Mesh Shading"

---

## 2026-01-14T15:54:32Z

ON "AntiGravity" slide.  Italicize "One-shot" in both occurences, but do not make it gold.  between the two one-shot bullets, add a bullet "Then free to vibe new features..."   .  change "Then vibed 3D WebGL charts of query results".  Change "built between train stops" to "Built between meetings and commutes"

---

## 2026-01-14T16:07:18Z

the QR codes should each hyperlink to their respective links, using the same link behaviors as others

---

## 2026-01-14T16:18:49Z

on "Vibe Coding for kids" also include links at the bottom for the project GitHub Pages:
https://conacademy.github.io/quadratic_explorer/
https://conacademy.github.io/proving_parallelograms/

---

## 2026-01-14T16:20:39Z

On the Wield this magic page.  let's change the bottom tagline to highlight the key technologies: "Multi-modal Models * Tool Calling * Agentic Loops * Vibe Coding"

---

## 2026-01-14T16:24:36Z

scan the presenter notes.  verify that they match the updated content of the page and apply any improvements you deem useful

---

## 2026-01-14T16:27:02Z

and yet another review for time please

---

## 2026-01-14T16:47:20Z

 on the Vibe Coding for Kids... fixup the linked bullet points so that the text goes to their GitHub Pages page and then add (repo) with a link to the GitHub repo, but leave the parentheses unlinked especially so they get different color

---

## 2026-01-14T16:57:37Z

i want this presentation to default to be Safe for Kids and Safe for work.  Topics of sex and drugs are not appreciated by all, even if they end up being the basis for learning.  This presentation will default to "safe mode"; we don't need any user interface to show off that mode.  By pressing 'X', that will toggle it out of safe-mode.   While you won't show a GUI button for this, when we are in NSFW mode, will put a small red X in the lower left corner, a bit to the right.  Mobile will always keep safe mode for now.

In safe mode, on the MCP Exploration slide, buttplug-mcp becomes ⬜⬜⬜⬜plug-mcp, we keep the styling and  there is no link.  We can keep dank-mcp and it's styling, but remove the link.   IN the last bullet point we say "structured datasets" instead of "cannabis datasets" Also the images of AgentDank and Buttplug.io are hidden.  We also remove any dank-mcp or buttplug links from the bottom.

In unsafe mode, the AgentDank image should go to https://github.com/AgentDank/  also buttplug-mcp had the wrong URL: https://github.com/ConAcademy/buttplug-mcp and should have its link at the bottom

---

## 2026-01-14T16:59:55Z

i want the redaction squares to match the green styling, is there a way to acheive that?

---

## 2026-01-14T17:00:21Z

also verify that the presenter notes are also redacted

---

## 2026-01-14T17:01:19Z

Can you suggest any other NSFW aspects of this presentation,  places to include this feature?

---

## 2026-01-14T17:05:05Z

in safe mode:
for 1, switch AgentDank to AgentDink 
for 2, change AgentDank to AgentDink, and hide the images.  sanitize the presenter notes in this mode
for 3. change "AgentDank dank-extract" to "AgentDink `dink-extract`" with no link 
for 4. remove AgentDank from the list

---

## 2026-01-14T17:07:12Z

do you have a suggestion for how to enable this mode on mobile? don't make any changes, just tell me

---

## 2026-01-14T17:08:08Z

If shake works, i think it would be hilarious. How prevalent is the support for that?

---

## 2026-01-14T17:11:52Z

i don't want to use a URL parameter.  let's use a long-press on the menu bar, pops up a dialog to toggle NSFW and a checkbox to enable shake, and if they do that checkbox then security is requested if needed.   we can use cookies to save this but that is the only cookie i want.  please check if we are using cookies already and if we are, report them to meusing cookies).  

---

## 2026-01-14T17:18:01Z

the long press is a pain, how about just double-tapping?

---

## 2026-01-14T17:20:23Z

i want to make it that it is only when you triple-tap (or if that's not possible double-tap) the Notes button.

---

## 2026-01-14T17:23:34Z

that's annoying too, because it can sometimes turn into a zoom -- what about tapping Notes and Full at the same time

---

## 2026-01-14T17:28:22Z

Remove all the aspects of shaking it and just have the Full+Notes combo toggle the safe mode.  We don't need a setting dialog either.  

---

## 2026-01-14T17:30:14Z

on the mcp server slide, in safe mode hide the agent dank movie too

---

## 2026-01-14T17:32:46Z

on the last page, the QR codes don't flow to a single column on mobile
on the title page and final page, put a bottom note that the presentation itself is Copyright (C) 2026 Evan Wies and MIT Licensed

---

## 2026-01-14T17:35:53Z

reformulate the readme given the current slide structure.  note and link the MIT License in Author section.  The @neomantra should go to my GitHub

---

## 2026-01-14T17:40:52Z

on the LLM-assisted Renaissance... capitolize the A in LLM-assisted.  Replace "This presentation" with the same styled "This Presentation" then "... (PROMPTS.md)" where the PROMPTS.md is a styled link to https://github.com/neomantra/presentations/blob/master/GolangMeetupJan2026/PROMPTS.md .. the ellipsis and parentheses remain unstyled

---

## 2026-01-14T17:42:38Z

go over the slides, make sure images flow properly for narrow windows and mobile

---

## 2026-01-14T17:55:06Z

i need to work on the content for mcp agent looping and screentime MCP.  review my hackernews history for what i've talked about it and help me develop this slide.  you can start with suggestions.  i think it is an important slide for noting the evolution from MCP to agent loop to give better tool description to enable it to help better. the crush angle doesn't really matter, and can be in presenter notes as an anecdote in a longer talk particularly  

---

## 2026-01-14T17:59:23Z

sorry continue, i didn't mean to interrupt

---

## 2026-01-14T18:04:34Z

that last summary output to a MEMORY.md file so you and i can refer to it later more easily.  You can note that MEMORY.md file in your CLAUDE.md.  I have one modification to the key narritive arc:  he slide should capture the "aha moment" - realizing that the bottleneck isn't the tool's power, but how well you describe it to the LLM, and you can use the LLM to help you do that"

---

## 2026-01-14T18:16:57Z

i have some tweaks to do, but how about you incoporate what you glean from the MEMORY.md , we will call the "MCP Agent Looping" slide "Self-improvement of MCP Server through Agentic Looping" and focus on that.  the bullet points are mostly there

for that slide, use a loop 🔄 emoji and add it to the timeline.  
First bullet point should read: "Built screentime-mcp — querying macOS ScreenTime database (SQLite)"

On the industry milestones slide and progressions, the robot and loop emojis should not be visible

instead of a plug, the mcp should be a hammer (tool).  update that everywhere.  also on the wield slide, next to each item on the bottom, put the related emoji (multimodal=eyes, tools = hammer, loops = loop, vibe = dizzy)

on the wield page, instead of a single line stack the text+ emoji vertically

---

## 2026-01-14T18:36:22Z

i guess the emojis can be on both sides of that

on mcp exploration, in safe mode it should be dink-mcp

on the artistic license hidden page, move it to after the weild page, in should say "<THIS SPACE IS INTENTIONALLY BLANK>" in the existing gold style.  When "F" is pressed, that will activate fallthrough mode which will show the Artistic License page. you can put an 🇫 indicator where the safemode indicator lives.  this can be activated by simultaneously pressing the prev/next buttons"

oh noes, F is much better for Fullscreen.  Restore that and the G key will activate it as a nod to their GoTime roots

on pages with double-digits, the safemode indicator is too close to the digits. it is also awkward relative to fallthrough indicator.  can you clean up that corner?

artistic license page activated doesn't look like the rest.  the title is centered  the january 2026 line isn't across.  can you check how it is implemented and fix it

looking good.  put a painting palette icon next to it, but you don't need to put that in the timeline.
for first line "Wanted to make something for Fallthrough" to"Wanted to make something Fallthrough inspired" with Fallthrough linked to https://fallthrough.transistor.fm/ and add that link to the bottom.
second line "Start with photo of hosts -> LLM iterates Swift🔄3MF -> optional human prompt -> 3MF"
third line: Fine-tune 3MF on additional reference, with face detection 🔄"
fourth line: modify "printed it" to "Printed It!:
put an info box with change to "Human -> Camera -> (Composited Image + Prompt) -> Swift code 🔄 3MF renders -> 3MF file -> G-Code -> Sculpture"
Remove the computational graphs line
Add the images FallthroughHostGrab.png and FallthroughCad1.png
After an advance, then you can reveal the image at images/FallthroughSculpture.png

there is now two host images FallthroughHostGrab.png and FallthroughHostGrab2.png.  (i manually edited one of them in).  they should be one above each other.
I also only want the "printed it" text after the final image reveal

great, center the two left images above each other.  also fix the responsive reflow with other columns
