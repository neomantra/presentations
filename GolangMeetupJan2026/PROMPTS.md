operate agent.md to create the presentation.  if you need a plan.md go ahead

---

to the timeline, which can be bigger i want to have icons for major themes, not every slide needs a new one
start with the eye emoji 👀 for multimodal.   
insert a new slide at 3 that has claude codes release date of february 24 2025 and include a claude icon init. subnote the beginning TUI re-acceptance (not Charm pivot to Crush) revolution.  
for MCP you can use a robot.   for gemini and opus and vibing you can put some waves or maybe the head with spiral eyes 😵‍💫
after you do that, i will review the rest.

put the icons below the timebar and don't reveal the unacheived milestones

---

## 2026-01-14T00:12:07Z

looking great.  we will tighten up the content.   since there was a bunch of javascript, let's start by you printing out the slide list

---

## 2026-01-14T00:13:36Z

since i will distribute this deck and have it live, I want links for relevant things.  i like your current format generally, but you can slide the content up and have a space underneath for relevant code or links.  for now do not put any code, but if there are relevant links, put them in the bottom

---

## 2026-01-14T00:18:37Z

for those links you added, put the full URLs in the bottom so people with photos can find it.  but you can add links to what you already highlight in the slides.

honestly how long would it take to present this, don't make any changes, just give me a per slide estimate and a total

---

## 2026-01-14T01:31:50Z

go ahead and condense all the corporate announcements, including nano banana, into a quick set of sections that advance on the same slide and expose their milestones as they go.  then we jump to my work with MCP servers.

---

## 2026-01-14T01:52:00Z

on the title page, you can put my name Evan Wies and my email evan@neomantra.net.

on the TUI page, put the images using  href https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/blob/main/cmd/ot-simplegen/demo.gif
https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/blob/main/cmd/ot-timechart/demo.gif 

for MCP server page, put it on its own sub-line and instead of "DataBento" put "`dbn-go-mcp` for DataBento market data, and a sub-line `buttplug-mcp` for device access, add its Github link.  then dank-mcp gets its own line and the rest.
embed https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-go/raw/main/cmd/dbn-go-mcp/claude_get_cost.png for dbn-go-mcp
embed https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb8e56f-178d-4646-9e0f-4fcf57614dea for dank-mcp with it queued at second 00:22.

that's enough for now

---

## 2026-01-14T03:54:48Z

we are continuing working on this presentation but we lost context.  review the directory

---

## 2026-01-14T03:56:55Z

i got it working on github pages at https://neomantra.github.io/presentations/GolangMeetupJan2026/presentation.html
i think we should rename presentation.html to index.html so it's picked up better.
also it doesn't work well on mobile, can you see if you can improve that at all?
