/init 

---

## 2026-01-13T23:38:56Z

operate agent.md to create the presentation.  if you need a plan.md go ahead

---

## 2026-01-14T00:06:22Z

to the timeline, which can be bigger i want to have icons for major themes, not every slide needs a new one
start with the eye emoji 👀 for multimodal.   
insert a new slide at 3 that has claude codes release date of february 24 2025 and include a claude icon init. subnote the beginning TUI re-acceptance (not Charm pivot to Crush) revolution.  
for MCP you can use a robot.   for gemini and opus and vibing you can put some waves or maybe the head with spiral eyes 😵‍💫
after you do that, i will review the rest.

---

## 2026-01-14T00:09:05Z

put the icons below the timebar and don't reveal the unacheived milestones

---

## 2026-01-14T00:12:07Z

looking great.  we will tighten up the content.   since there was a bunch of javascript, let's start by you printing out the slide list

---

## 2026-01-14T00:13:36Z

since i will distribute this deck and have it live, I want links for relevant things.  i like your current format generally, but you can slide the content up and have a space underneath for relevant code or links.  for now do not put any code, but if there are relevant links, put them in the bottom

---

## 2026-01-14T00:18:37Z

for those links you added, put the full URLs in the bottom so people with photos can find it.  but you can add links to what you already highlight in the slides.

---

## 2026-01-14T00:24:19Z

add a slide for google releasing the successful image model nano banana on august 26 2025.  give it a banana emoji

---

## 2026-01-14T00:27:56Z

also add a slide for deepseek r1 20 january 2025, using reinforcement learning and an open weights and research papers.  also add a slide for anthropic releasing model context protocol on november 25 2024

---

## 2026-01-14T00:30:50Z

honestly how long would it take to present this, don't make any changes, just give me a per slide estimate and a total

---

## 2026-01-14T01:31:50Z

go ahead and condense all the corporate announcements, including nano banana, into a quick set of sections that advance on the same slide and expose their milestones as they go.  then we jump to my work with MCP servers.

---

## 2026-01-14T01:52:00Z

on the title page, you can put my name Evan Wies and my email evan@neomantra.net.

on the TUI page, put the images using  href https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/blob/main/cmd/ot-simplegen/demo.gif
https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/blob/main/cmd/ot-timechart/demo.gif 

for MCP server page, put it on its own sub-line and instead of "DataBento" put "`dbn-go-mcp` for DataBento market data, and a sub-line `buttplug-mcp` for device access, add its Github link.  then dank-mcp gets its own line and the rest.
embed https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-go/raw/main/cmd/dbn-go-mcp/claude_get_cost.png for dbn-go-mcp
embed https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/adb8e56f-178d-4646-9e0f-4fcf57614dea for dank-mcp with it queued at second 00:22.

that's enough for now

---

## 2026-01-14T02:18:15Z

on the mcp  add this image of agentdank in images.
on the antigravity page add the dank-webchat and dank-data-explorer images

---

## 2026-01-14T02:19:29Z

on the ollamatea page, add https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NimbleMarkets/ollamatea/main/tests/ollamatea-512.png as the first image

---

## 2026-01-14T02:20:38Z

put the ollamatea image to the right of the buleltpoints instead

---

## 2026-01-14T02:23:46Z

next to agent dank you can put buttplug.io https://buttplug.io/assets/images/logo-38018d3af54f9cadbcfa380c51e63cb7.png

---

## 2026-01-14T02:30:54Z

add the proving parallelograms and quadratic equations image

---

## 2026-01-14T02:33:05Z

on the vibe coding for kids page, i want you to use the images in the images directory, proving-paralleograms.png and quadratic-explorer.png

---

## 2026-01-14T02:41:35Z

on the vibe baot engineering, add a boat emjoji to the slide title, but not the timeline.  add the images in the images directory: WeaselToonBowUpgrade.png  vibe-engineering-1.png vibe-engineering-2.png

---

## 2026-01-14T02:55:30Z

make an analysis of how long this presentation will take.  don't make assumptions about my time limits

---

## 2026-01-14T03:00:22Z

Keep everything for it but hide the artistic license slide, i will unhide it later in my process

---

## 2026-01-14T03:54:48Z

we are continuing working on this presentation but we lost context.  review the directory

---

## 2026-01-14T03:56:55Z

i got it working on github pages at https://neomantra.github.io/presentations/GolangMeetupJan2026/presentation.html
i think we should rename presentation.html to index.html so it's picked up better.
also it doesn't work well on mobile, can you see if you can improve that at all?

---

## 2026-01-14T04:17:50Z

On multimodal debugging, put pictures of proving-parallelograms-bug.png and proving-parallelograms-bugfix.png .  in between put my prompt `a friend discovered a bug in this.  look at the attached picture, figure out what the bug is and correct it.`

---

## 2026-01-14T04:20:20Z

i have added the  missing file  try again

---

## 2026-01-14T04:22:27Z

on the antigravity+frontier models page, vibe coding for kids page, multimodal debugging page , and vibe boat engineering page, you can increase the image sizes by 15%

---

## 2026-01-14T04:24:36Z

now each of the images on those pages and the mcp exploration page, i want clicking the image to open their respective image in a new window, i will use it to zoom in during the presentation.  do for all except for agentdank himself and the buttplug, they don't need to be linked

---

## 2026-01-14T04:29:24Z

it's a bit of a pain on mobile because of the interface.  is there a full-screen mode that's possible?

---

## 2026-01-14T04:33:58Z

on the final llm-renessaince page, 
for NTChart multimodal + terminal testing, hyperlink that to https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/ntcharts/issues/7
for AgentDank improvements, put AgentDank `dank-extract` and hyperlink to https://github.com/AgentDank/dank-extract
for OSS devops: Travis -> GitHub Actions hyperlink to https://github.com/openresty/docker-openresty/issues/289
for this presentation, link to https://github.com/neomantra/presentations/tree/master/GolangMeetupJan2026 

---

## 2026-01-14T04:42:03Z

rename the title slide from "My LLM Journey" to "We've Turned The Corner" and the subtitle from "From Experiments to Practial Work" to "From LLM Experients to Practical Execution"

---

## 2026-01-14T04:43:25Z

meh Practial Execution is lame ... I want to say i get practical work done in utilizing these new technologies

---

## 2026-01-14T04:45:02Z

From LLM Experiments to Getting Work Done

---

## 2026-01-14T04:51:10Z

since it wraps around , put a slide with a FIN sign to demarcate the end of the presentation. you can make the FIN sign fancy like the old time movies.

---

## 2026-01-14T04:54:29Z

it is not going fullscreen on my iphone... anything we can do about that?

---

## 2026-01-14T11:26:33Z

on the multimodal debugging slide, add an inital text that say "Full debugging cycle from a screenshot"
then the next line that says "Simple input, harnessing:"
 * Multi-modal understanding
 * Tool calling
 * Agentic looping

---

## 2026-01-14T11:28:12Z

you can take multiple indented lines for the bullet points afters harnessing

---

## 2026-01-14T11:33:45Z

change "multi-modal understanding" to "multi-modal capability" and add a line for "world understanding" under it

---

## 2026-01-14T11:37:17Z

on that page, center the "See image ->" line

---

## 2026-01-14T12:55:50Z

Add a Jun 2025 slide Take a Shot at Vibe Coding.   Vibe coding was getting popular, I already used Copilot auto-complete heavily and was constantly asking the LLMs coding questions.  I tried to make an AgentDank website, starting with an age verification screen, without concentrating on the code at all.  When I did look at the code, I wasn't too happy with it.  After a few hours I still had nothing useful and felt behind what my natural tempo and I stopped, considering it not ready.

---

## 2026-01-14T13:22:39Z

on that slide, put a thumbs down emoji to signify my failure.  add it to the timeline, but don't include it with the industry achievements reveal

---

## 2026-01-14T13:24:12Z

on the industry milestones page can you hide the thumbs down in the timeline?

---

## 2026-01-14T13:25:31Z

on the LLM-assisted renaissance page, add a rocketship emoji and also include it in the timeline

---

## 2026-01-14T13:56:09Z

create a readme.md for humans, which describes the REPOSITORY and VIBE CODING A PRESENTATION aspect.  You can also include a summary and the slides table of contents, but the page is just an introduction to the presentation, the contents of the presentation speak for themselves

---

## 2026-01-14T13:59:27Z

near the top, add a link to the PROMPTS.md and note to the reader that they can read the evolution there, or see the checkpoints at the commits page https://github.com/neomantra/presentations/commits/master/

---

## 2026-01-14T14:05:04Z

create a QR code with the following link https://neomantra.github.io/presentations/GolangMeetupJan2026/    in the center should be the logo in images/neomantra-logo-blue.png and it should have a black border with a rounded rectangle enclosing it.  Underneath is a filled rounded rectangle with the word "Deck" underneatch in sans serif font and contrasting color consistent with the presentation.  place that qr code image in the images directory and add it to the main slide.

---

## 2026-01-14T14:11:24Z

that's great, can you make the deck bubble below the QR code as wide as the qr code, the word Deck can be a bit bigger

---

## 2026-01-14T14:12:26Z

deck should be double the size and bold and all caps

---

## 2026-01-14T14:21:36Z

that's great.  also make a qrcode with the same logo but go to this URL https://github.com/neomantra/presentations/tree/master/GolangMeetupJan2026 and with the word "REPO" underneath

---

## 2026-01-14T14:23:14Z

i've tested that and it looks great.  you can add it to the title slide, to the right of the other QR code.  leave some horizontal seperation from them to make it easier for cameras to disambiguate.   also add them to the final fin slide

---

## 2026-01-14T14:26:31Z

on the title page, you can make them larger and centered beneath the contact information.  

---

## 2026-01-14T14:27:04Z

make them 25% larger and add a little more horizontal separation

---

## 2026-01-14T14:27:34Z

again, make them 25% larger and add a little more horizontal separation

---

## 2026-01-14T14:28:14Z

that's great, now make them 260px and then apply all the same styling to the qr codes on the fin page

---

## 2026-01-14T14:32:27Z

I had SuperGrok review the presentation and we came up with a better title and subtitle.  The title is now "LLM Odyssey 2025" and the subtitle is "From TUI Experiments to Agentic Wins in Golang".   Go through and update the relevant documents to reflect this change including the README.md and CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files. be sure to update the <title> too. 

---

## 2026-01-14T14:35:39Z

on my iphone 17, sometimes a bunch of the content appears under the floating URL bar and other UX.  It makes it impossible to read.  is there a better way to handle that?

---

## 2026-01-14T14:40:07Z

Also on the title page, keep the timeline but hide the eyeballs, they are intended for the TUI+Multimodal Models slide.  
On the TUI+Multimodal Models slide, change the title to "Local LLM TUI + Multimodal Models" Change the Combined with `dbn-go` DetaBento library" to say "Combined with `dbn-go` [DataBento market data](https://github.com/NimbleMarkets/dbn-go/)"  .  also include that link in the set of explicit links at the bottom

---

## 2026-01-14T14:43:38Z

on the Local LLM TUI slide, in its title change "Multimodal Models" to "Multi-modal Models".  In this slides timeline, the plug emoji is revealed, that is for the next slide page.  change the `dbn-go` styling to be the same as the OllamaTea and NTCharts links and you can unlink "DataBento"

---

## 2026-01-14T14:48:04Z

on the industry milestones page, don't show the plug emoji until the first industry milestone reveal.  you can also add these links https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeepSeek for DeepSeek and for nanobanana add this link https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/products/nano-banana-pro/     change it so that the links at the bottom are revealed as the page advances

---

## 2026-01-14T14:55:56Z

on the MCP Exploration page, change dbn-go-mcp and buttplug-mcp to have the same styling as dank-mcp.  Change  "Built MCP servers" to "Built MCP servers with mcp-go" and link mcp-go to https://github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go .  For "Cannabis dataset queries via DuckDB + Claude" put "Connect Claude with cannabis datasets via DuckDB SQL".

---

## 2026-01-14T15:00:29Z

on Vibe Boat Engineering, add a timeline item with the same boat emoji.  Change "Multimodal CAD assistance" to "Multi-modal mechanical design assistance" and link "pontoon boat" to https://tinypontoonboats.com and add a link at the bottom and change "improvment" to "upgrade"

---

## 2026-01-14T15:02:12Z

in the timeline the boat overlaps with the rocketship, can you slide it to the left a little bit even if it doesn't mathematically match the temporal proportion

---

## 2026-01-14T15:05:41Z

On "Take this stuff and solve your problems with it!" rename it to "Wield this magic1\nUse it to solve your problems..."  also since it is a concluding slide you can vertically center it all more.

---

## 2026-01-14T15:09:21Z

The mobile version got a little worse when you changed it before.  The top of the slides are always covered by the iphone status bar (this is ios 26).  also the QR codes lose their aspect ratio in this mode and become unreadable.  I will use the responsive mode of safari to help test this in our iterations, i wasn't doing that before

---

## 2026-01-14T15:13:19Z

you can make the qr code bigger, maybe max 60%.  the primary issue for them was the aspect ratio
