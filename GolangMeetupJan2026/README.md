## About This Repository

This presentation was itself vibe coded — built entirely through conversation with Claude Code. The HTML, CSS, JavaScript, responsive design, and even this README were generated through natural language prompts rather than manual coding.

The irony isn't lost: a talk about the journey from TUI experiments to agentic wins, delivered via a presentation that demonstrates exactly that evolution.

## Vibe Coding a Presentation

The presentation is a single `index.html` file with:
- Custom slide navigation (arrow keys, swipe on mobile)
- Timeline gauge showing progression from Nov 2024 to Jan 2026
- Milestone icons that appear as the timeline advances
- Progressive reveal on Industry Milestones slide
- Presenter notes (press `N`)
- Fullscreen mode (press `F`)
- Safe mode for kid-friendly presentations (press `X` or tap Notes+Full simultaneously)
- Artistic License reveal bonus content (press `G` or tap Prev+Next simultaneously)
- Responsive design with iOS safe area support
- iOS "Add to Home Screen" support for true fullscreen on mobile

No frameworks. No build step. Just HTML/CSS/JS generated through conversation.
