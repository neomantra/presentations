# Presentation Plan

## Format Decision
**HTML slides** using reveal.js-style structure (self-contained single HTML file)
- Supports the timeline gauge requirement in upper right
- Easy to present from any browser
- Can embed images and styling

3. **Apr 2025: MCP Exploration** (~1.5 min)
   - dank-mcp for cannabis datasets with DuckDB
   - Learnings: tool descriptions matter, LLMs like structured markdown, APIs aren't always meant to be wrapped

4. **May 2025: MCP Agent Looping** (~1.5 min)
   - AgentDank and screentime-mcp development
   - Key insight: world knowledge + SQL = deterministic answers, then iterate

   - Live coding on smartboard

7. **Late Dec 2025: Multimodal Debugging** (~1.5 min)
   - Friend's bowtie shape error
   - Auto: see image error → create fix → create test → run in Chrome → screenshot → report

8. **Late Dec 2025: Vibe Boat Engineering** (~1.5 min)

## Timeline Gauge
- Horizontal progress bar in upper right corner
- Simple, informational (not flashy)
- Shows current position from Nov 2024 to Jan 2026

## Presenter Notes
Each slide will have hidden presenter notes with:
- Key talking points
- Timing cues
- Links to demos/repos if needed
