to the timeline, which can be bigger i want to have icons for major themes, not every slide needs a new one
start with the eye emoji 👀 for multimodal.   
insert a new slide at 3 that has claude codes release date of february 24 2025 and include a claude icon init. subnote the beginning TUI re-acceptance (not Charm pivot to Crush) revolution.  
for MCP you can use a robot.   for gemini and opus and vibing you can put some waves or maybe the head with spiral eyes 😵‍💫
after you do that, i will review the rest.

looking great.  we will tighten up the content.   since there was a bunch of javascript, let's start by you printing out the slide list

since i will distribute this deck and have it live, I want links for relevant things.  i like your current format generally, but you can slide the content up and have a space underneath for relevant code or links.  for now do not put any code, but if there are relevant links, put them in the bottom

for those links you added, put the full URLs in the bottom so people with photos can find it.  but you can add links to what you already highlight in the slides.

honestly how long would it take to present this, don't make any changes, just give me a per slide estimate and a total

go ahead and condense all the corporate announcements, including nano banana, into a quick set of sections that advance on the same slide and expose their milestones as they go.  then we jump to my work with MCP servers.
