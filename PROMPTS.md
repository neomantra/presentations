to the timeline, which can be bigger i want to have icons for major themes, not every slide needs a new one
start with the eye emoji 👀 for multimodal.   
insert a new slide at 3 that has claude codes release date of february 24 2025 and include a claude icon init. subnote the beginning TUI re-acceptance (not Charm pivot to Crush) revolution.  
for MCP you can use a robot.   for gemini and opus and vibing you can put some waves or maybe the head with spiral eyes 😵‍💫
after you do that, i will review the rest.
